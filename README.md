# Personal Portfolio Site - React + TypeScript + Vite
Hey, thanks for being here!
The main goal for this site was to have fun and create something I'm proud of.
I discovered motion design and creative development for myself earlier this year, and decided I wanted to make the switch eventually. This site was me learning some related technologies (ThreeJS, GSAP), as well as exploring my inspirations through design. I had a lot of fun!

## Instructions
To run the site locally, just clone the repo, then run `npm run install` followed up `npm run dev`. 

## Demo
You can view this site on https://fokichev.com. The live auto-updated version is also on https://portfolio-site-rouge-mu.vercel.app.
(There's animations, check it out!)
